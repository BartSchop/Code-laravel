    <h4>About the {{ $boss_info->name }}</h4>
    The King Black Dragon (named Shakorexis by Hannibus) is an enormous, three-headed black dragon. He was the second dragon ever, created by Kerapac's fellow dragonkin Phalaks; a failed project intended to replicate the powerful Queen Black Dragon[1] some time in or before the First Age. One decade later, he was released into the Wilderness.

    Killing the King Black Dragon at least once is one of the requirements of redeeming the Dragonkin lamp from Mr. Mordaut.

    The King Black Dragon was made available to free-to-play players on 29 February 2016.
