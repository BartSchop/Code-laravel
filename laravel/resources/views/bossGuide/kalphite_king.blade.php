    <h4>About the {{ $boss_info->name }}</h4>
    The Kalphite King, formerly dubbed the "Toughest Boss in RuneScape history", is a boss monster who can be found in the Exiled Kalphite Hive.

    The Kalphite King was first mentioned at RuneFest 2011 in Mod Mark's RuneScape 2012 speech. The Kalphite King is the only monster in the game that can drop the Drygore longsword, mace and rapier, along with their off-hand versions, powerful melee weapons that require 90 attack in order to wield.

    The fight with the Kalphite King is a challenge that requires players to be adept with the action bar system and changes with the introduction of the Evolution of Combat. The King is also able to summon marauders to his aid.

    The Kalphite King will not allow dwarf multicannons to be set up. Dreadnips and dominion mines can be used, however the latter will not do any damage. Players may leave any time they wish, by teleporting, dying or leaving by the slope they used to enter the lair.
